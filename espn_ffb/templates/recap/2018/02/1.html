        <p>If A.J. Green's 3td (<a href="https://www.clippituser.tv/c/bnqeyy">1</a>-<a href="https://www.clippituser.tv/c/wxedpz">2</a>-<a href="https://www.clippituser.tv/c/qvbamy">3</a>) performance in the 1st half of Thursday night's game didn't discourage
          {{ r.opponent }} from showing up, surely he had to question his ability to pull off a comeback after Ben Roethlisberger dropped 41 points on 39-60 with 452yd and 4td including one rushing.
          As <a href="https://www.clippituser.tv/c/rybwwa">Big Ben dived into the endzone without consent</a>, so too did {{ r.opponent }}'s chance of a W.

          The return of Mark Ingram II comes in two weeks and {{ r.team }} must be ecstatic about that as he stays undefeated heading into week 3 2-0. Meanwhile, {{ r.opponent }} drops to 1-1 and hopes to put this abysmal performance behind him.
