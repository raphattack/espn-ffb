        <p>Despite <a href="https://streamable.com/kh1co">Keelan Cole making the grab of the year</a> and Stefon Diggs' fourth quarter heroics (<a href="https://streamable.com/kqu87">3yd td catch</a>,
          <a href="https://streamable.com/uj6cv">75 yd td catch</a>, <a href="https://streamable.com/octf9">2pt conversion</a>), {{ r.team }} was unable to overcome an all-around solid performance by CIROC 84.
          <br><br>
          While the Lions' continue to look woeful, Matt Stafford turned in a 347yd 3td performance, racking up a solid 25.7 points.
          JuJu Smith-Schuster put on another impressive performance with 13 receptions on 19 targets for 121yd and a td, good for 25.6 points and had some fun in the endzone with a little shoutout to Naruto fans.

          {{ r.opponent }} <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/LeadingNFL/status/1041391014747860992">Rasengan'd</a> {{ r.team }} to improve to 1-1 on a night when only one player other than his kicker was in single digits.
          {{ r.team }} falls to 0-2 and looks to bring stronger chakra next week.
