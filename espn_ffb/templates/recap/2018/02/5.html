        <p>Both Todd Gurley II and Saquon Barkley failed to reach 50yd rushing, but they made up for it in other ways. Gurley made up for it with an insanely efficient 3td with those 42yd.
          Barkley used his hands to reel in 14 receptions for 80yd as Eli had to dump off quick screens in order to save his life.

          While Eli could do little to change his situation behind that horrendous o-line, the self-proclaimed (only?) rookie of the year {{ r.team }} held his fate in his own hands.
          Andy Dalton sat on the bench with enough points to swing the result, but the rook made a rookie mistake sticking with fellow rookie Sam Darnold.

          {{ r.opponent }} flexes his muscles like <a href="https://streamable.com/pegx5">Michael Thomas on the game-winning TD catch</a> and bounces to a 2-0 start.
          {{ r.team }} looks as dazed and confused as Eli while he tries to figure out how he ended up 1-1.
