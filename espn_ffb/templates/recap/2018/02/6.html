          Magic is in the air and it comes with a double dose of 75 TD passes from Ryan Fitz<s>patrick</s>magic to <a href="https://streamable.com/ztnd2">Desean Jackson</a> and <a href="https://streamable.com/mgs8m">OJ Howard</a>.
          Blake Bortles added in 36.6 points throwing for 377yd and 4td including a <a href="https://streamable.com/jkspd">61yd td to Dede Westbrook</a>. Unfortunately for {{ r.opponent }}, Dede was sitting on the bench while Jamison Crowder turned in a stinker.

          Even with 10 of his players under 10 points, {{ r.opponent }} had a chance to steal a victory after his opponent accidentally left Marcus Mariota in the lineup. {{ r.opponent }} was ahead by 9.2 points heading into Monday night, but Allen Robinson's
          13.3 point game secured the victory for {{ r.team }}. Melvin Gordon bolstered {{ r.team }}'s day with a hat trick in the 1st half

          {{ r.team }} lets his chest hair out at the postgame conference as he improves to 1-1. {{ r.opponent }} questions whether he still believes in magic after his 0-2 start.
